What does to-do-list do?
    -takes user input and stores in a list.
    -the user input is the "tasks"
        tasks require 
            description/title, 
            date,
            priority?,
            project (that it belongs to),
            completed
            METHODS: 
                markComplete() {this.completed = "yes", or "no" if starts at yes}
                toProject() change the project property to an existing project
    -tasks can be placed into separate "projects"
    -tasks need to belong to certain projects, with the default being the first project that's already open
            so we can add the property "project:" to the task object/class
            projects need to interact with DOM to show only the tasks belonging to the project
                can use a loop that checks the "project:" property to determine if the task should show in DOM
    default "project" page can be ALL, which shows all tasks, regardless of project.
    
Need a function that expands a to-do which will show its description
Function to delete an item
function to toggle between projects

need a spot for input - - -
